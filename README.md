# Cybersecurity Scripts
This repository contains a collection of small, standalone scripts written in various programming languages. Each script is designed to accomplish a specific task and can be easily executed without needing a larger framework or project setup.

The scripts included here cover a range of use cases, from automation tasks and system utilities to small tools for learning and experimentation.


## Getting Started
To get started, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: first, clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scripts.git
   cd scripts
```
2. **Check the individual script folders**: each script is organized into its own directory, and inside each directory, you’ll find a `README.md` file that provides specific instructions for that script.
3. 
4. **Install dependencies (if necessary)**: some scripts may require specific dependencies or libraries. These are usually listed in the corresponding `README.md` or in comments at the top of the script.
5. 
6. **Run the script**: each script is intended to be run independently. Follow the instructions in the individual `README.md` of each script to execute it properly.
